5 Things to learn from WALL·E.

- It’s been 11 years since Disney Pixar released Wall E and the movie is still relevant. Wall E is a movie about a trash cleaning robot and his adventure and love.
- Wall E, the robot, cleans the trash highly littered earth which is abandoned by humans. Humans have hibernated themselves in a gigantic spaceship where they have been living for around 700 years now. The spaceship sends other robots on earth to find the chances of living on a trash filled planet.
- Eva, a robot sent by humans on earth to find life meets Wall-E who is a technically less advanced robot than eva. Eva finds out a plant growing in Wall-E’s compartment where he lives. The story grows from there. The movie shows the struggle of Eva and Wall-E to safely deliever the plant to the spaceship.
- The movie has a lot of lessons that us humans need to learn. Some of them are mentioned below:
- We need to stop producing trash, we need to start reducing the amount of waste that we generate everyday. It’s going to end the world sooner or later. We might save ourselves with the help of technology but still it won’t be good for humanity.
- We should start taking care of plants and trees. The movie shows the character Wall-E treating a plant with such care that it looks adorable. I wish more of us humans start taking care of plants and trees and our surroundings.
- We might feel like we are just humans and we don’t have any superpowers. But our ability to express ourselves is a super power in itself and we should use it for the betterment. Communication is the key.
- Technology has always helped us. It is still doing its job. It has made us connect with eachother at distances. It has never made us lose connectivity but we have lost the human touch. Look around yourself, everyone is on their phone. You can easily find this happening when you travel in a bus or a train or while just simply walking, we are surrounded by technology and not humans.
- At the end, home is the best feeling and the best moments are at home. No matter how much we enjoy outside, no matter how much we explore, but the happiness is at home and this earth is our home as well. Take care of it.
