description: "This film is intended to be a biography, which begins with Confucius in his later years, during a time of exile, and flashes back to his time as a young man, a teacher, a husband, and a philosopher in the 5th century BCE. The movie retained some criticism for romanticizing the life of the titular character with a few extra action scenes and stories of military."

A few things I have learnt from Confucius.

- Be kind to people around you, be kind to the world

- Anything you don't want to happen to yourself, don't impose it on others.

- Keep learning, until the day you die.

- Be humble, and learn from others. Anybody has something you can learn from.
