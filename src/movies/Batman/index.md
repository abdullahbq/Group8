To me, Batman is something more than a fictional character from graphic novels. He represents the good and the evil in all of us; the constant struggle we each face in our daily lives, the fear we hide deep within. But most of all he represents hope.

Perhaps the one lesson we should never, ever forget. Pretty self-explanatory.
Batman might have been a psychological wreck from the inside, but it was ultimately what he did that defined him. He went through the tragedy of his parents' death, which could have destroyed his life. Instead, he devoted himself to an idealâ€¦ and truly became a legend.

The list goes on, as the many answers will surely supplement these ones.
But as a true fanboy, I would go one step further and exaggerate that any life lessons you can think of, you can find an example in the life of Bruce / Batman. :)

Off the top of my head, a handful ones are -

- Given enough time of preparation and research, you can face the strongest enemy and win eventually.

- Never give up.

- You should strive not to gain reputation for your good deeds, but to do those good deeds for no reason other than that they are good.

- All villains, of every kind, are superstitious and cowardly.

- That out of tragedy can come greatness.
